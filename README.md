## Introduction

The 2019 Lok Sabha elections were a significant event in Indian politics. This project aims to analyze the candidates' data and predict election outcomes using machine learning techniques, focusing on the Random Forest algorithm.

## Data

The data used in this project includes:

- Candidate details (name, party, constituency, age, gender, etc.)
- Performance in the election
- Socioeconomic and demographic data of constituencies

The data is collected from public sources, including the Election Commission of India, news articles, and other reliable datasets.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Gathering data from various sources and cleaning it.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the data to find patterns and insights.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating features for the machine learning model.
4. **Model Selection & Training**: Building and training the Random Forest model to predict election outcomes.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Data Analysis

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the data, exploring various factors such as:

- Candidate demographics
- Party affiliations
- Past performance and trends
- Constituency profiles

## Machine Learning Predictions

A Random Forest model was used to predict the likelihood of a candidate's victory. The model was trained on historical data and evaluated using accuracy, precision and other relevant metrics.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2019-lok-sabha-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 2019-lok-sabha-analysis
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Results

The project achieved an accuracy of 96% on the test dataset, with significant insights gained from the EDA. The detailed results and findings are documented in the `reports` directory.
