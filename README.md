## Introduction

The 2019 Lok Sabha elections were a significant event in Indian politics. This project aims to analyze the candidates' data and predict election outcomes using machine learning techniques. We focus on various factors, including candidates' backgrounds, previous election performance, and more.

## Data

The data used in this project includes:

- Candidate details (name, party, constituency, age, gender, etc.)
- Election results from previous years
- Socioeconomic and demographic data of constituencies

The data is collected from public sources, including the Election Commission of India, news articles, and other reliable datasets.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Gathering data from various sources and cleaning it.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the data to find patterns and insights.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating features for the machine learning models.
4. **Model Selection & Training**: Building and training models to predict election outcomes.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Data Analysis

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the data, exploring various factors such as:

- Candidate demographics
- Party affiliations
- Past performance and trends
- Constituency profiles

## Machine Learning Predictions

Several machine learning models were used to predict the likelihood of a candidate's victory, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Neural Networks

The models were trained on historical data and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2019-lok-sabha-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 2019-lok-sabha-analysis
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Analysis**: Explore the data using the Jupyter notebooks provided in the `notebooks` directory.
2. **Model Training**: Train the machine learning models using the scripts in the `models` directory.
3. **Prediction**: Use the trained models to make predictions on new data.

## Results

The project achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset, with significant insights gained from the EDA. The detailed results and findings are documented in the `reports` directory.
